# lsl_dummy

A dummy project for testing LSL v1.16.2 locally.  
Refer to "README-Unity" in [this]((https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Csharp?tab=readme-ov-file)https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Csharp?tab=readme-ov-file) repo for instructions on how the the C-sharp bindings are setup. It also contains the LSL.cs file which is directly integrated inside the project and then used as a library for inlet/outlet scripts.  
  
I have also used vscode, which is why there is a .vscode folder instead of .vs
Don't know how this affects for the ones working in different IDEs
